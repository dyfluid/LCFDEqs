# LaCFDEqs

**LaCFDEqs** includes the common turbulence equations implemented in OpenFOAM. Users only need to include **LaCFDEqs** package in the document, and they can directly invoke the embedded  formulas to display it in the text without having to write it themselves. These turbulence formulas are taken from the implementation of open source CFD code OpenFOAM-10.
